 60 minutes
### Done
Looking into refactoring to have a skeleton view provided by the controller. Depending on the users choices and login status, other controllers take over to provide the skeleton with the proper content e.g. login form, logout button and functionality related to logged in user. 

The first controller will check for login status, this means that the structures default view is that of login form.

I have fully broken the functionality of the login system in order to initialize the move to the new structure. Not yet fully clear on final structure but better to get something to work than overthinking it.

### Done
More thinking on the problem and how to divide the different controllers. Not much code written but got a clearer idea on how to proceed. 

Got the login view back after fully broken the application.

### To do next
Refactor the login view in a manner that can be used for the new use cases.

Considering writing a calculator and write code to handle operator precedence.
