# PHP App- Linneaus university course in code quality

The interesting part for me was the opportunity to try to implement a classic shunting yard algorithm to make the calculator. This was not mandatory but it is sucha classic algorithm that I hade to make one. Also trying PHP was an interesting endevour although it is hardly my favourite language.
